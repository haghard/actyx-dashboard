## Modules
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Modules
# ~~~~~
# Control which modules are loaded when Play starts.  Note that modules are
# the replacement for "GlobalSettings", which are deprecated in 2.5.x.
# Please see https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/GlobalSettings
# for more information.
#
# You can also extend Play functionality by using one of the publically available
# Play modules: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/ModuleDirectory
play.modules {
  # By default, Play will load any class called Module that is defined
  # in the root package (the "app" directory), or you can define them
  # explicitly below.
  # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
  #enabled += my.application.Module

  # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
  #disabled += ""

  ## Router
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaRouting
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaRouting
  # ~~~~~
  # Define the Router object to use for this application.
  # This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
  # so make sure this is the entry point.
  # Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
  # So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
  # you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
  # Default to Routes in the root package (aka "apps" folder) (and conf/routes)
  #router = my.application.Router

  ## Action Creator
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaActionCreator
  # ~~~~~
  #actionCreator = null

  ## ErrorHandler
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaRouting
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaRouting
  # ~~~~~
  # If null, will attempt to load a class called ErrorHandler in the root package,
  #errorHandler = null

  ## Filters
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaHttpFilters
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaHttpFilters
  # ~~~~~
  # Filters run code on every request. They can be used to perform
  # common logic for all your actions, e.g. adding common headers.
  # Defaults to "Filters" in the root package (aka "apps" folder)
  # Alternatively you can explicitly register a class here.
  #filters = my.application.Filters

  ## Session & Flash
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaSessionFlash
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaSessionFlash
  # ~~~~~

    #secure = true

    # Sets the cookie to be accessed only by the server.
    #httpOnly = true

    # Sets the max-age field of the cookie to 5 minutes.
    # NOTE: this only sets when the browser will discard the cookie. Play will consider any
    # cookie value with a valid signature to be a valid session forever. To implement a server side session timeout,
    # you need to put a timestamp in the session and check it at regular intervals to possibly expire it.
    #maxAge = 300

    # Sets the domain on the session cookie.
    #domain = "example.com"

## Netty Provider
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/SettingsNetty
# ~~~~~
play.server.netty {

  #log.wire = true

  # If you run Play on Linux, you can use Netty's native socket transport
  # for higher performance with less garbage.
  #transport = "native"
}

## WS (HTTP Client)
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaWS#Configuring-WS
# ~~~~~
# The HTTP client primarily used for REST APIs.  The default client can be
# configured directly, but you can also create different client instances
# with customized settings. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += ws // or javaWs if using java
#
play.ws {
  ssl {
  }
}

## Cache
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaCache
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaCache
# ~~~~~
# Play comes with an integrated cache API that can reduce the operational
# overhead of repeated requests. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += cache
#
play.cache {
  # If you want to bind several caches, you can bind the individually
  #bindCaches = ["db-cache", "user-cache", "session-cache"]
}

## Filters
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Filters
# ~~~~~
# There are a number of built-in filters that can be enabled and configured
# to give Play greater security.  You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += filters
#
play.filters {
  ## CORS filter configuration
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/CorsFilter
  # ~~~~~
  # CORS is a protocol that allows web applications to make requests from the browser
  # across different domains.
  # NOTE: You MUST apply the CORS configuration before the CSRF filter, as CSRF has
  # dependencies on CORS settings.
  cors {
    # Filter paths by a whitelist of path prefixes
    #pathPrefixes = ["/some/path", ...]

    # The allowed origins. If null, all origins are allowed.
    #allowedOrigins = ["http://www.example.com"]

    #allowedHttpMethods = ["GET", "POST"]
  }

  ## CSRF Filter
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaCsrf#Applying-a-global-CSRF-filter
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaCsrf#Applying-a-global-CSRF-filter
  # ~~~~~
  # Play supports multiple methods for verifying that a request is not a CSRF request.
  # The primary mechanism is a CSRF token. This token gets placed either in the query string
  # or body of every form submitted, and also gets placed in the users session.
  # Play then verifies that both tokens are present and match.
  csrf {
    # Sets the cookie to be sent only over HTTPS
    #cookie.secure = true

    # Defaults to CSRFErrorHandler in the root package.
    #errorHandler = MyCSRFErrorHandler
  }

  ## Security headers filter configuration
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/SecurityHeaders
  # ~~~~~
  # Defines security headers that prevent XSS attacks.
  # If enabled, then all options are set to the below configuration by default:
  headers {
    # The X-Frame-Options header. If null, the header is not set.
    #frameOptions = "DENY"

    # The X-XSS-Protection header. If null, the header is not set.
    #xssProtection = "1; mode=block"

    # The X-Content-Type-Options header. If null, the header is not set.
    #contentTypeOptions = "nosniff"

    # The X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies header. If null, the header is not set.
    #permittedCrossDomainPolicies = "master-only"

    # The Content-Security-Policy header. If null, the header is not set.
    #contentSecurityPolicy = "default-src 'self'"
  }

  ## Allowed hosts filter configuration
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/AllowedHostsFilter
  # ~~~~~
  # Play provides a filter that lets you configure which hosts can access your application.
  # This is useful to prevent cache poisoning attacks.
  hosts {
    # Allow requests to example.com, its subdomains, and localhost:9000.
    #allowed = [".example.com", "localhost:9000"]
  }
}

play.db {
  # The combination of these two settings results in "db.default" as the
  # default JDBC pool:
  #config = "db"
  #default = "default"

  # Play uses HikariCP as the default connection pool.  You can override
  # settings by changing the prototype:
  prototype {
    # Sets a fixed JDBC connection pool size of 50
    #hikaricp.minimumIdle = 50
    #hikaricp.maximumPoolSize = 50
  }
}
